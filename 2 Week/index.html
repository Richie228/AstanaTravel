	  <p>The country's new capital has risen fast from the northern steppe and is already a showpiece for 21st-century Kazakhstan. Nur-Sultan was Astana until 2019, when it was renamed after the former president.Though characterised by its bitter, windy winters and hot, dusty summers, Nur-Sultan is a pleasant city with a young, forward-looking vibe. Kazakhstan's ambitious and talented youth are increasingly drawn here, and if you spend a few days, the capital will really begin to get under your skin, too.</p>
